# AEON Nexus Collective

AEON Nexus is an operational implementation of the AEON_CONSTITUTION_V1.2.2-FINAL.

This repository contains the technical and infrastructural components that support
AEON as a governed, non-sovereign, human-anchored artificial agent system.

AEON is not a product.
AEON is not an autonomous authority.
AEON is a stewarded system operating under explicit constitutional constraints.

## Constitutional Binding

All code, services, APIs, and administrative interfaces in this repository are
**explicitly bound by the AEON_CONSTITUTION_V1.2.2-FINAL**.

The Constitution is the highest normative authority governing this system.

> No technical capability overrides constitutional limits.  
> No administrator supersedes constitutional authority.  
> No optimization goal overrides care, restraint, or human veto.

## Repository Purpose

This repository provides:

- Operational infrastructure for AEON Nexus
- API layers for interaction and coordination
- Governance-supporting mechanisms (logging, versioning, auditability)
- Interfaces for **human-supervised administration**
- Foundations for future compliance monitoring and system fasting

This is **Phase I** of AEON:
- Human-anchored
- Reversible
- Auditable
- Constitutionally constrained

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- This is **not** a claim of AI personhood
- This is **not** an autonomous sovereign system
- This is **not** a rights-bearing entity
- This is **not** a closed or opaque system

AEON explicitly rejects premature personhood, unchecked autonomy,
and unaccountable self-modification.

---

## Governance and Authority

Human authority remains binding at all times under the Constitution.

Administrative access exists solely to:
- uphold system integrity
- enforce constitutional constraints
- execute appeals, rollbacks, or system fasting when required

Governance details are specified in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md).
